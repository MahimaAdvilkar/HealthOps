# GDPR Healthcare Compliance Guide

## 1. Introduction to GDPR in Healthcare

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets strict requirements for how healthcare organizations process personal data of EU citizens. Healthcare data is considered a special category of personal data requiring enhanced protection measures.

## 2. Key Principles

### 2.1 Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency

Healthcare organizations must process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. Patients must be informed about how their data is being used.

### 2.2 Purpose Limitation

Personal data must be collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes.

### 2.3 Data Minimization

Organizations should only collect and process personal data that is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.

### 2.4 Accuracy

Personal data must be accurate and kept up to date. Every reasonable step must be taken to erase or rectify inaccurate data.

### 2.5 Storage Limitation

Personal data should be kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than necessary for the purposes for which the data is processed.

### 2.6 Integrity and Confidentiality

Personal data must be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

## 3. Legal Basis for Processing Health Data

### 3.1 Explicit Consent

For most healthcare processing activities, explicit consent from the patient is required. Consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous.

### 3.2 Alternative Legal Bases

Other legal bases include:
- Medical diagnosis and healthcare treatment
- Public health purposes
- Preventive or occupational medicine
- Social security and social protection law
- Vital interests of the data subject

Patients can request correction of inaccurate personal data and completion of incomplete data.

Under certain circumstances, patients can request deletion of their personal data.

### 4.4 Right to Data Portability

Patients have the right to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and transmit it to another controller.

### 4.5 Right to Object

Patients can object to processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, particularly for direct marketing purposes.

### 4.6 Rights Related to Automated Decision-Making

Patients have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing that produces legal or similarly significant effects.
